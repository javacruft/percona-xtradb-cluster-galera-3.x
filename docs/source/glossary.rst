   Galera Replication Plugin
      Galera Replication Plugin is a general purpose replication plugin for any transactional system. It can be used to create a synchronous multi-master replication solution to achieve high availability and scale-out.
      
      See :ref:`Galera Replication Plugin <Galera Replication Plugin>` for more details.

   Global Transaction ID
      To keep the state identical on all nodes, the *wsrep API* uses global transaction IDs (GTID), which are used to both:

        - Identify the state change
        - Identify the state itself by the ID of the last state change

      The GTID consists of:

        - A state UUID, which uniquely identifies the state and the sequence of changes it undergoes
        - An ordinal sequence number (seqno, a 64-bit signed integer) to denote the position of the change in the sequence
          
      See :ref:`wsrep API <wsrep API>` for more details.

   Primary Component
      In addition to single node failures, the cluster may be split into several components due to network failure. In such a situation, only one of the components can continue to modify the database state to avoid history divergence. This component is called the Primary Component (PC). 
      
      See :ref:`Primary Component <Primary Component>` for more details.
   
   wsrep API
      The *wsrep API* is a generic replication plugin interface for databases.  The API defines a set of application callbacks and replication plugin calls.
      
      See :ref:`wsrep API <wsrep API>` for more details.

   State Snapshot Transfer (SST)
      State Snapshot Transfer refers to a full data copy from one cluster node (donor) to the joining node (joiner). See also the definition for Incremental State Transfer (IST).
      
      See :ref:`State Snapshot Transfer (SST) <State Snapshot Transfer (SST)>` for more details.

   Incremental State Transfer (IST)
      In incremental state transfer, a node only receives the missing write-sets and catch up with the group by replaying them. See also the definition for State Snapshot Transfer (SST).
      
      See :ref:`Incremental State Transfer (IST) <Incremental State Transfer (IST)>` for more details.
      
   Writeset Cache (GCache)
      Galera stores write sets in a special cache called Writeset Cache (GCache).  In short, GCache is a memory allocator for write sets and its primary purpose is to minimize the write set footprint on the RAM.
      
      See :ref:`Writeset Cache (GCache) <Writeset Cache (GCache)>` for more details.

   Galera Arbitrator
      If the expense of adding, for example, a third datacenter is too high, you can use the Galera arbitrator. An arbitrator is a member of the cluster which participates in voting, but not in actual replication.
      
      See :ref:`Galera Arbitrator <Galera Arbitrator>` for more details.

   Rolling Schema Upgrade
      The rolling schema upgrade is a :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing method, where the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` will only be processed locally at the node. The node is desynchronized from the cluster for the duration of the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing in a way that it does not block the rest of the nodes.  When the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing is complete, the node applies the delayed replication events and synchronizes back with the cluster.
      
      See :ref:`Rolling Schema Upgrade <Rolling Schema Upgrade>` for more details.

   Total Order Isolation
      By default, :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` statements are processed by using the Total Order Isolation (TOI) method. In TOI, the query is replicated to the nodes in a statement form before executing on master. The query waits for all preceding transactions to commit and then gets executed in isolation on all nodes simultaneously.
      
      See :ref:`Total Order Isolation <Total Order Isolation>` for more details.
