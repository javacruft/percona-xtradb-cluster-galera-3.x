 Replication API
===================
.. _`Replication API`:

As we learned in the introduction, synchronous replication uses eager replication, where the nodes keep all other nodes synchronized by updating all replicas in a single transaction.  In other words, when a transaction commits, all nodes have the same value. This takes place by using writeset replication over group communication.

The Galera Cluster replication architecture software entities are 

- **Database Management System (DBMS)**, such as MySQL, MariaDB or Percona XtraDB.

- **wsrep API** provides the interface and the responsibilities for the DBMS and replication provider. 
  
  The wsrep API consists of:

  - **wsrep hooks** The wsrep integration in the DBMS engine.

  - **dlopen** The ``dlopen()`` function to make the wsrep provider available to *wsrep hooks*. 

- **Galera Replication Plugin** provides the wsrep service functionality.

- **Group communication plugins** Galera can use various group communication systems. For example, ``gcomm`` and `Spread <http://www.spread.org/>`_.

The entities above are depicted in the figure below and explained in more detail in the chapters below:

The write-set replication API is a generic replication plugin interface for databases.  The API defines a set of application callbacks and replication plugin calls. 

The wsrep API is used in a replication model where an application, such as a database server, has a state. In practice, the state refers to the contents of the database. When the database is used, clients modify the database contents and the database state changes. This changing of the state is represented as a series of atomic changes (transactions). In
a database cluster, all nodes always have the same state, which they synchronize with each other by replicating and applying state changes in the same serial order.

From a more technical perspective, the state change process is as follows:

1. A state change takes place on the database.

2. The wsrep hooks within the database populate the write-sets for the other database nodes in the cluster.

3. The wsrep provider functions are made available for the wsrep hooks through the ``dlopen()`` function.

4. The Galera Replication Plugin handles the writeset certification and replication to the other database nodes in the cluster.

At the receiving end, the application process takes place by high priority transaction(s).

To keep the state identical on all nodes, the wsrep API uses a Global Transaction ID (GTID), which is used to both:

- Identify the state change

- Identify the state itself by the ID of the last state change

The GTID consists of:

- A state UUID, which uniquely identifies the state and the sequence of changes it undergoes.

- An ordinal sequence number (seqno, a 64-bit signed integer) to denote the position of the change in the sequence.
  

By using the GTID, you can

- Compare the application states

- Establish the order of state changes

- Determine whether the change was applied or not

- Whether the change is applicable at all to a given state (in short, whether it is all-powerful)

In a human-readable format, the GTID might look like this::

 Galera Replication Plugin
---------------------------
.. _`Galera Replication Plugin`:

Galera Replication Plugin implements the wsrep API and operates as the wsrep provider.  From a more technical perspective, it consists of:

- **Certification layer** prepares the write-sets and performs the certification.

- **Replication layer** manages the replication protocol and provides the total ordering
  capability.
  
- **Group communication framework** provides a plugin architecture for various group
  communication systems.

 Group Communication Plugins

.. index::
   pair: Virtual Synchrony; Descriptions

The group communication framework provides a plugin architecture for various group communication systems.

Galera Cluster is built on top of a proprietary group communication system layer which implements virtual synchrony :abbr:`QoS (Quality of Service)`. Virtual synchrony unifies the data delivery and cluster membership service, which provides clear formalism for message delivery semantics. 

Virtual Synchrony guarantees consistency, but not temporal synchrony, which is required for smooth multi-master operation. For this purpose, Galera implements its own runtime-configurable temporal flow control, which keeps nodes synchronized to a fraction of second.

The group communication framework also provides total ordering of messages from multiple sources, which is used to build Global Transaction IDs in a multi-master cluster. 

At the transport level, Galera Cluster is a symmetric undirected graph, where all database nodes are connected with each other over a :abbr:`TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)` connection. By default, TCP is used for both message replication and the cluster membership service, but also :abbr:`UDP (User Datagram Protocol)` multicast can be used for replication in a :abbr:`LAN (Local Area Network)`.
