 Schema Upgrades
==========================
.. _`Schema Upgrades`:

A schema upgrade refers to any :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` statement run for the database. :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` statements change the database structure and are non-transactional.

:abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` statements are processed in two different methods in Galera Cluster.  These methods are described in the chapters below.

.. note:: See also the ``pt-online-schema-change`` command in `Percona Toolkit for MySQL <http://www.percona.com/software/percona-toolkit>`_.

 Total Order Isolation

By default, :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` statements are processed by using the Total Order Isolation (TOI) method. In TOI, the query is replicated to the nodes in a statement form before executing on master. The query waits for all preceding transactions to commit and then gets executed in isolation on all nodes simultaneously.  When using the TOI method, the cluster has a part of the database locked for the duration of the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing (in other words, the cluster behaves like a single server).

The isolation can take place at the following levels:

1. At the server level, where no other transactions can be applied concurrently (for ``CREATE SCHEMA``, ``GRANT`` and similar queries).

2. At the schema level, where no transaction accessing the schema can be applied concurrently (for ``CREATE TABLE`` and similar queries).

3. At the table level, where no transaction accessing the table can be applied concurrently (for ``ALTER TABLE`` and similar queries).

TOI queries have several particularities  that must been taken into consideration:

- From the perspective of certification:

  - TOI transactions never conflict with preceding transactions, since they are only executed after all preceding transactions were committed. Hence, their certification interval is of zero length. This means that TOI transactions will never fail certification and are guaranteed to be executed.
  
  - Certification takes place on a resource level. For example, for server-level isolation this means any transaction that has a TOI query in its certification interval will fail certification.

- The system replicates the TOI query before execution and there is no way to know whether it succeeds or fails. Thus, error checking on TOI queries is switched off.

- The method is simple, predictable and guarantees data consistency.

- The disadvantage is that the cluster behaves like a single server, potentially preventing high-availability for the duration of :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` execution.

 Rolling Schema Upgrade
---------------------------------
.. _`Rolling Schema Upgrade`:
.. index::
   pair: Descriptions; Rolling Schema Upgrade
.. index::
   pair: Parameters; wsrep_OSU_method

As of wsrep API patch 5.5.17-22.3, you can choose whether to use the traditional total order isolation method or the rolling schema upgrade method. You can choose the rolling schema upgrade method by using the global parameter ``wsrep_OSU_method``.

The rolling schema upgrade is a :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing method, where the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` will only be processed locally at the node. The node is desynchronized from the cluster for the duration of the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing in a way that it does not block the rest of the nodes. When the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` processing is complete, the node applies the delayed replication events and synchronizes back with the cluster.

To upgrade a schema cluster-wide, the :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` must be manually executed at each node in turn. When the rolling schema upgrade proceeds, a part of the cluster will have the old schema structure and a part of the cluster will have the new schema structure.

.. warning:: While the rolling schema upgrade has the advantage of blocking only one node at a time, it is potentially unsafe, and may fail if the new and old schema definitions are incompatible at the replication event level. Execute operations such as ``CREATE TABLE`` and ``DROP TABLE`` in TOI.
