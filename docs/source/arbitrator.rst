If the expense of adding, for example, a third datacenter is too high, you can use Galera Arbitrator. Galera Arbitrator is a member of the cluster which participates in voting, but not in actual replication.

.. warning:: Galera Arbitrator does not participate in actual replication, but it receives the same data as the nodes. Use a secure network connection for the arbitrator.

Galera Arbitrator servers two purposes:

- It helps to avoid split-brain situations by acting as an odd node in a cluster that is spread only across two nodes.

- It can request a consistent application state snapshot.

Galera Arbitrator is depicted in the figure below:

   *Galera Arbitrator*

In the figure above, if one of the data centers fails or loses WAN connection, the node that sees the arbitrator (and therefore sees clients) will continue operation.

.. note:: ``garbd`` must see all replication traffic although it does not store it anywhere. Placing the arbitrator in a location with poor connectivity to the rest of the cluster may lead to poor cluster performance.

Arbitrator failure does not affect cluster operation and a new instance can be reattached to the cluster at any time. There can be several arbitrators in the cluster.

As a Galera Cluster cluster member, Galera Arbitrator accepts all Galera Cluster
parameters except those prefixed by ``replicator.``.

 Starting Galera Arbitrator
----------------------------
.. _`Starting Galera Arbitrator`:

Galera Arbitrator it is a separate daemon called ``garbd``. You can start is manually as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ /etc/init.d/garb start 

You can also add configuration options to the command.

You can also automate running Galera Arbitrator by using an ``/etc/default/garb`` init script, such as the one below:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Copyright (C) 2013 Codership Oy
    # This config file is to be sourced by garb service script.
    
    # A space-separated list of node addresses (address[:port]) in the cluster
    GALERA_NODES="192.168.1.1:4567 192.168.1.2:4567"
    
    # Galera cluster name, should be the same as on the rest of the nodes.
    GALERA_GROUP="example_wsrep_cluster"
    
    # Optional Galera internal options string (e.g. SSL settings)
    # see http://www.codership.com/wiki/doku.php?id=galera_parameters
    GALERA_OPTIONS="socket.ssl_cert = /etc/galera/cert/cert.pem; socket.ssl_key = /$
    
    # Log file for garbd. Optional, by default logs to syslog
    LOG_FILE="/var/log/garbd.log"
