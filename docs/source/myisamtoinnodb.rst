These instructions describe how to migrate from the MyISAM storage engine to the InnoBD storage engine on Galera Cluster. These instructions are applicable to both a standalone MySQL server and a stock MySQL master-slave cluster that uses the MyISAM storage engine.

Proceed as follows:

1. Create a Galera Cluster cluster. The cluster can consist of one node only, if necessary.

2. Stop all load on the MyISAM master.

3. Initialize the Galera Cluster by performing a ``mysqldump`` with ``--skip-create-options``. After this operation, the database will by default create InnoDB tables on the cluster.

4. Resume the load on one of the cluster nodes.

5. Upgrade the *mysqld* on the former master to Galera Cluster software.

6. Convert the tables to the InnoDB format on the former master node.

7. Copy the ``grastate.dat`` file from one of the cluster nodes to the former master.

8. Open the ``grastate.dat`` file and change the ``seqno`` value from ``-1`` to ``0`` there.

9. Join the former master to the Galera Cluster.

The downtime for the migration is the time it takes to perform step 3.
