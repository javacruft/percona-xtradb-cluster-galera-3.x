Galera Cluster has the following differences to a standalone MySQL server:

- Replication only works with the InnoDB storage engine. Any writes to tables of other types, including system (``mysql.*``) tables are not replicated. However, DDL statements are replicated at the statement level, and changes to ``mysql.*`` tables will get replicated that way. In other words, you can safely issue command ``CREATE USER...`` or ``GRANT...``, but issuing ``INSERT INTO mysql.user...`` will not be replicated. 
  
  In general, non-transactional engines cannot be supported in multi-master replication.
  
- Rows in tables without primary key may appear in different order on different nodes. As a result, command ``SELECT...LIMIT...`` may return slightly different sets. The ``DELETE`` operation is also unsupported on tables without primary key.

  Do not use tables without a primary key. It is always possible to add an ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` column to a table without breaking your application.

- Unsupported queries:

    - ``LOCK``/``UNLOCK TABLES`` cannot be supported in master-master replication.
    
    - Lock functions (``GET_LOCK()``, ``RELEASE_LOCK()...``)

- Query logs cannot be directed to a table. If you enable query logging, you must forward the log to a file::
  
    log_output = FILE

  Use ``general_log`` and ``general_log_file`` to choose query logging and log file name.
  
- Do not use a query cache.

- XA transactions cannot be supported due to possible rollback on commit.

- Transaction size. While Galera Cluster does not explicitly limit the transaction size, a writeset is processed as a single memory-resident buffer and, as a result, extremely large transactions (for example, ``LOAD DATA``) may adversely affect node performance. To avoid that, the ``wsrep_max_ws_rows`` and ``wsrep_max_ws_size`` variables limit the transaction rows to 128 K and the transaction size to 1 Gb, by default. If necessary, you can increase those limits.

- Due to cluster level optimistic concurrency control, a transaction issuing a ``COMMIT`` may still be aborted at that stage. There can be two transactions writing the to same rows and committing in separate cluster nodes, and only one of the them can successfully commit. The failing one will be aborted.
  
  For cluster level aborts, Galera Cluster gives back a deadlock error::
  
     code (Error: 1213 SQLSTATE: 40001  (ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK))

  In this case, restart the failing transaction.
  
- Windows OS is not supported.

- Do not use ``binlog-do-db`` and ``binlog-ignore-db``. These binary log options are only supported for DML, but not for DDL. Using these options will create a discrepancy and replication will abort.

- Do not use server system variables ``character_set_server``, ``utf16`` or ``utf32`` or ``ucs2`` if you choose rsync as a state transfer method.  The server will crash.
