In normal operation, a Galera Cluster node does not consume much more memory than a regular MySQL server. Additional memory is consumed for the certification index and uncommitted write-sets, but usually this is not noticeable in a typical application. However, writeset caching during state transfer makes an exception.

When a node is receiving a state transfer, it cannot process and apply incoming write sets because it has no state to apply them to yet. Depending on a state transfer mechanism (for example, ``mysqldump``), the node that sends the state transfer may not be able to apply write sets. Instead, the node must cache the write sets for a catch-up phase. The Write-set Cache (GCache) is used to cache write sets on memory-mapped files on disk. These files are allocated as needed. In other words, the limit for the cache is the available disk space. Writing on disk reduces memory consumption.

 Dealing with Large Transactions
------------------------------------
.. _`Dealing with Large Transactions`:

If you must frequently handle large transactions, such as transactions caused by the ``DELETE`` command that may delete millions of rows from a table at once, we recommend using the Percona toolkit's ``pt-archiver`` command. For example::

  $ pt-archiver --source h=dbhost,D=keystone,t=token \
  	--purge --where "expires < NOW()" --primary-key-only \
  	--sleep-coef 1.0 --txn-size 500

This tool deletes rows efficiently. For more information on the tool, see the `pt-archiver manpage <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.1/pt-archiver.html>`_.
