 Cluster Deployment Variants
==============================
.. _`Cluster Deployment Variants`:

Galera Cluster consists of nodes. We recommend that you have at least three nodes in your cluster. Each cluster node is a regular MySQL server and you convert your existing MySQL server into a node and use that server as the cluster base. 

Due to its synchronous multi-master qualities, the Galera Cluster can be seen as a single server listening at many interfaces. To give you an idea of what Galera Cluster is capable of, we will consider a typical N-tier application and discuss different benefits and considerations of deploying Galera Cluster in that context.

-------------------
 No Clustering
-------------------

The figure below depicts an N-tier application cluster without clustering. Since the upper tiers are usually stateless, you can start up as many instances as necessary without any concern for synchronization; the instances store their data in the data tier.

This is a simple and easy-to-manage solution. However, the :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` server at the data tier is a :abbr:`SPoF (Single Point Of Failure)` and a performance bottleneck.

 Whole Stack Cluster
--------------------

The figure below depicts an N-tier application cluster using whole stack clustering, where each stack has a dedicated database server.

   *Whole Stack Cluster*

This is a simple and easy-to-manage solution, especially if you can install the whole stack in one physical machine. Due to the direct connection from the application tier to the :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)`, the solution has low latencies.

Whole stack clustering has the following challenges:

- :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` failure fails the whole stack.

- Inefficient resource usage:

  - Having a dedicated database server for each application stack is overuse.
  
  - Poor resource consolidation. One server with a 7Gb buffer pool is much faster than two servers with 4Gb buffer pools.

- Increased unproductive overhead: each server duplicates the work of others.

- Increased rollback rate due to cluster-wide conflicts.

- Inflexibility. There is no way to limit the number of master nodes, or perform intelligent load-balancing.
  
Despite a long list of considerations, this setup can be usable
for several applications. 


-------------------
 DBMS-tier Cluster
-------------------

To address the shortcomings of the whole stack cluster scheme, we can cluster the data tier separately and present it to the application as a single virtual server. The figure below depicts this solution.

   *DBMS-tier Cluster*

In this solution, the failure of one node does not affect the rest of the cluster. Furthermore, resources are consolidated better and the setup is flexible: nodes can be assigned different roles by using intelligent load balancing.

DBMS-tier clustering has the following challenges:

- The structure is complex. A load balancer is involved and it must be backed up in case of failures. This typically means that you must have two more servers and a failover solutions between them.

- Management is more complex. The load balancer must be configured and reconfigured, when a :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` node is added to or removed from the cluster.

- Connections to the :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` servers are not direct. If you place a proxy between the application and the server, you end up with increased latencies for each query.  This can easily become a performance bottleneck (load-balancing servers should be very powerful).

- An attempt to spread this setup over several datacenters may cancel resource consolidation benefits, as each datacenter will have to have at least two :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` servers.
  
DBMS-tier Cluster with Distributed Load Balancing
=================================================

We can improve the DBMS-tier cluster by placing a dedicated load balancer on each application server. The figure below depicts this solution.

.. figure:: images/galerausecases3.png

   *DBMS-tier Cluster with Distributed Load Balancing*

In DBMS-tier cluster with distributed load balancing the load balancer is no longer a single point of failure. Furthermore, the load balancer scales with the application cluster and is unlikely to become a bottlenecks. Finally, the client-server communication latencies are lower.

DBMS-tier clustering with distributed load balancing has the following challenges:

- There are N load balancers to manage and reconfigure when the database cluster configuration changes.

Aggregated Stack Cluster
========================

We can also create a hybrid setup where we can aggregate several application stacks to use a single :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` server. The figure below depicts this solution.

.. figure:: images/galerausecases4.png

   *DBMS-tier Cluster with Distributed Load Balancing*

This solution improves the resource utilization of the whole stack cluster and still maintains its relative simplicity and direct DBMS connections benefits. This is how a DBMS-tier cluster with distributed load balancing would look like, if we only use one :abbr:`DBMS (Database Management System)` node per datacenter.  This can be a good setup for sites, which are not very big, but still are hosted at more than one datacenter.
