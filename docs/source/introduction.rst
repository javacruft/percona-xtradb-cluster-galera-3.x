Database replication refers to the frequent copying of data from one node, that is, a database on one server, to a node on another server. A database replication system is, in other words, a distributed database in which all nodes share the same level of information. This system is also known as a database cluster.

The database client (such as a Web browser or a computer application) does not see the database replication system in any way, but experiences close to native :abbr:`DBMS (DataBase Management System)` behavior.

 Masters and Slaves
---------------------
.. _`Masters and Slaves`:

Many database management systems replicate databases. The most common replication method is to create a master/slaves relationship between the original data set (master) and its copies (slaves).  The master logs the updates to the data, and propagates the logs through a network to the slaves. The slaves, for their part, receive a stream of updates from the master and apply the changes accordingly.

A master/slaves relationship is depicted in the figure below:

Another common replication method is to create a multi-master replication system, where updates can be submitted to any database node, and then propagated through a network to other database nodes. In other words, all database nodes act as masters, and no logs or update success indications are sent. 

A multi-master replication system is depicted in the figure below:

From a more technical perspective, asynchronous and synchronous replication protocols differ in the way they propagate database transactions to other nodes in the database cluster:

- Synchronous replication uses an approach known as eager replication. In eager replication, the nodes keep all replicas synchronized by updating all replicas in a single transaction. In other words, when a transaction commits, all nodes have the same value.

- Asynchronous replication uses an approach known as lazy replication. In lazy replication, the master database asynchronously propagates replica updates to other nodes after the replicating transaction commits.  In other words, when a transaction commits, nodes can have different values at least for a short while.

Theoretically, synchronous replication has several advantages over asynchronous replication:

- Synchronous replication provides highly available clusters and guarantees 24/7 service availability, as:

  - There is no data loss when one of the nodes crashes
  - Data replicas are always consistent
  - There are no complex, time-consuming failovers
  
- Transactions can be executed on all nodes in parallel to increase performance.

- Synchronous replication can guarantee causality across the whole cluster. For example, a ``SELECT`` statement issued after a transaction always sees the effects of the transaction even if it were executed on another node.

Traditionally, eager replication protocols coordinated nodes one operation at a time, using *2-phase commit* or distributed locking. In a system with *x* nodes and *y* operations, a throughput of *z* transactions per second requires *x* |times| *y* |times| *z* messages per second. When the number of nodes increases, transaction response times,
conflict probability and deadlock rates grow exponentially. This has led to a situation where asynchronous replication remains the dominant means for database performance scalability and availability. Widely adopted open-source databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL only offer asynchronous replication solutions.

 Solving the Issues in Synchronous Replication
-----------------------------------------------
.. _`Solving the Issues in Synchronous Replication`:

To solve the problems in the traditional synchronous replication systems and approaches, researchers all around the world have, in the last couple of years, suggested alternative approaches to synchronous database replication. In addition to theory, prototype implementations have shown a lot of promise. The most important improvements these studies have brought about are:

- **Group communication** is a high-level abstraction that defines patterns for the communication of database nodes to guarantee the consistency of replicated data.

- **Write-sets** bundle database writes into a single *write-set* message, thus avoiding the coordination of nodes one operation at a time.

- **Database State Machine** processes read-only transactions locally on a database site, and update transactions are first executed locally on a database site (on shadow copies), and then broadcast as a read set to the other database sites for certification and possibly commit.

- **Transaction Re-ordering** means that transactions are re-ordered before they are committed and broadcast to the other database sites. Reordering increases the number of transactions that successfully pass the certification test.

Galera Cluster's certification based replication builds on these approaches.
