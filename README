This is Galera replication - Codership's implementation of the write set 
replication (wsrep) interface (https://launchpad.net/wsrep/). The software and 
other files in this directory unless otherwise noted are distributed under 
GPLv2, see COPYING for details.


BUILDING - general

Build Requirements:
* Scons build system http://www.scons.org/
* Check unit test library http://check.sourceforge.net/
* Boost devel package http://www.boost.org/
* OpenSSL devel package

To compile, in Galera root directory do either:
 $ scons
(default optimized build)
or
 $ ./scripts/build.sh
(see ./scripts/build.sh --help for information on options)

To build MySQL/Galera demo distribution, branch lp:codership-mysql into
some directory (hereafter <MYSQL_DIR>) and run build script from this
directory (hereafter <GALERA_DIR>):

 $ cd <MYSQL_DIR>
 $ bzr branch lp:codership-mysql
 $ cd <GALERA_DIR>
 $ MYSQL_SRC=<MYSQL_DIR>/codership-mysql ./scripts/mysql/build.sh -b -s -o -t

After successful build, demo package can be found under scripts/mysql.


BUILDING on CentOS/RHEL 5

CentOS/RHEL by default uses a very old version of GCC and a likewise ancient
version of BOOST that lacks important features. In order to build Galera on
CentOS/RHEL one needs to:

 1) Install gcc44 and gcc44-c++ packages and set CC and CXX variables
    accordingly:
    # yum install gcc44 gcc44-c++
    # export CC=gcc44
    # export CXX=g++44
 2) Remove standard boost and boost-devel packages (if present)
 3) Install boost141-devel package:
    # yum install boost141-devel
 4) Make link from /usr/include/boost to /usr/include/boost141:
    # cd /usr/include
    # ln -sf boost141/boost boost
 5) Install scons check-devel openssl-devel
    # yum install scons check-devel openssl-devel

Then proceeed as described above.
